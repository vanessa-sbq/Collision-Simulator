# Collision-Simulator

This simulator inspired by [Walter Fendt's Collision Simulator](https://www.walter-fendt.de/html5/phpt/collision_pt.htm) demonstrates the change in velocity, linear momentum, and kinetic energy after the collision of two bodies under given initial conditions of mass and velocity, taking into account a restitution factor that can vary between 0 and 1. The simulation also shows the bodies in motion based on the introduced parameters.

## User Instructions
1. Alter the coefficient of restitution.

2. Choose the characteristics of the bodies. The mass of the bodies can vary between 0.1 and 1. The velocity of body 1 (red) can vary between 0 and 1. The velocity of body 2 (blue) can vary between -1 and 0

3. Choose the quantity you want to visualize. You can choose between the following options:
    - Velocity before and after the collision
    - Linear momentum before and after the collision
    - Kinetic energy before and after the collision
  
4. Activate slow motion to visualize the animation in slow motion (This option can also be activated/deactivated during the movement).

5. Start the animation (Button "Start").

6. Reset the simulator to the initial values (Button "Reset").

## How to Run the Project
If you want to run this project, I would recommend opening the Visual Basic solution with Visual Studio. You will need to have .NET installed. The project interface might look weird if your screen resolution is not set to the default.
