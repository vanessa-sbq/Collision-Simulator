# Collision-Simulator

This simulator demonstrates the change in velocity, linear momentum, and kinetic energy after the collision of two bodies under given initial conditions of mass and velocity, taking into account a restitution factor that can vary between 0 and 1. The simulation also shows the bodies in motion based on the introduced parameters.
