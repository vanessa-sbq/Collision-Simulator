# Collision-Simulator

This simulator inspired by [Walter Fendt's Collision Simulator](https://www.walter-fendt.de/html5/phpt/collision_pt.htm) demonstrates the change in velocity, linear momentum, and kinetic energy after the collision of two bodies under given initial conditions of mass and velocity, taking into account a restitution factor that can vary between 0 and 1. The simulation also shows the bodies in motion based on the introduced parameters.

## User Instructions
1. Alter the coefficient of restitution.

2. Choose the characteristics of the bodies. The mass of the bodies can vary between 0.1 and 1. The velocity of body 1 (red) can vary between 0 and 1. The velocity of body 2 (blue) can vary between -1 and 0

3. Choose the quantity you want to visualize. You can choose between the following options:
    - Velocity before and after the collision
    - Linear momentum before and after the collision
    - Kinetic energy before and after the collision
  
4. Activate slow motion to visualize the animation in slow motion (This option can also be activated/deactivated during the movement).

5. Start the animation (Button "Start").

6. Reset the simulator to the initial values (Button "Reset").
